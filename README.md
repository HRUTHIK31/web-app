# web-app

It is a full-stack web application with Python and Django3. Django is one of the most popular web frameworks for Python and is used to program the back-end side of our web app. Through this project I learned how to create models, how to route URL requests, how to create different views for our web app, how to integrate HTML templates and a lot more.
